# BlendSketch
Sketch based mesh editing interface built for Blender in C.  This actually has no business not containing the Blender source code as well but I'm more just abusing Github for cloud storage.   It is currently being built off commit b1f918bcc53d552dec2a5327b15f77751dca0712. 

Progress module depends on two small computational geometry utilities (still WIP):
